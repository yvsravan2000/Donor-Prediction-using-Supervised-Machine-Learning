# Donor-Prediction-using-Supervised-Machine-Learning
Our goal is to predict if an individual earns more or less than $50,000 based on attributes in the adult income dataset on Kaggle to help non-profit organizations determine if an individual is a potential donor. This can be useful in determining donation requests.
