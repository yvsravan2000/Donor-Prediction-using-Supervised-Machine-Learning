# Donor-Prediction-using-Supervised-Machine-Learning

Our goal is to predict if an individual earns more or less than $50,000 based on attributes in the adult income dataset on Kaggle to help non-profit organizations determine if an individual is a potential donor. This can be useful in determining donation requests.

### Abstract
In this project, our goal is to correctly predict whether a given individual makes a profit of greater than 50,000 or less than 50,000 based on a set of attribute features which are already provided from the adult_income dataset from Kaggle: "https://www.kaggle.com/wenruliu/adult-income-dataset". This model can help non-profit organizations which certainly depends on donation to correctly predict the donation that the organization has to request an individual based on the individual records. So, with the data available we can come to conclusion that an individual can be a donor or not.
